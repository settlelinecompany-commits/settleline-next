    question: "What is RNOR status and how does it benefit me?",
    answer: "RNOR (Resident but Not Ordinarily Resident) is a special tax status in India that provides significant tax benefits for US-India cross-border professionals. It offers exemption from tax on foreign income and favorable treatment of capital gains during your initial years of return to India, potentially saving you thousands in taxes."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does the RNOR planning process take?",
    answer: "The RNOR planning process typically takes 3-6 months for comprehensive planning, but we recommend starting 6-12 months before your intended return to India. This allows time for strategic asset restructuring, income timing optimization, and proper documentation preparation."
  },
  {
    question: "What documents do I need for US-India tax planning?",

  },
  {
    question: "How much can I save with proper RNOR planning?",
    answer: "Our clients typically save $15,000-$50,000+ through strategic RNOR planning, depending on their income level and asset portfolio. The savings come from foreign income exemptions, capital gains optimization, and strategic asset restructuring during the RNOR period."

  {
    question: "What if I'm already in India? Can I still benefit from RNOR planning?",
