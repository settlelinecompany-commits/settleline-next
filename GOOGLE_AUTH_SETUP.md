# Google OAuth Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up Google Sign-In for your Settleline application using Supabase Auth.

## üöÄ Quick Setup Steps

### 1. Create Google OAuth Credentials

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the Google+ API:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" ‚Üí "Library"
   - Search for "Google+ API" and enable it
4. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" ‚Üí "Credentials"
   - Click "Create Credentials" ‚Üí "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs"
   - Choose "Web application"
   - Add authorized redirect URIs:
     - `https://your-project-ref.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`
     - `http://localhost:3000/auth/v1/callback` (for development)

### 2. Configure Supabase Auth

1. Go to your [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Navigate to your project ‚Üí "Authentication" ‚Üí "Providers"
3. Find "Google" and click "Enable"
4. Enter your Google OAuth credentials:
   - **Client ID**: From Google Cloud Console
   - **Client Secret**: From Google Cloud Console
5. Save the configuration

### 3. Update Redirect URLs

Make sure these URLs are added to your Google OAuth configuration:

**Production:**
```
https://your-project-ref.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback
```

**Development:**
```
http://localhost:3000/auth/v1/callback
http://localhost:3002/auth/v1/callback
```

### 4. Test the Integration

1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Visit `http://localhost:3002/auth`
3. Click "Continue with Google"
4. Complete the OAuth flow
5. Verify you're redirected to `/dashboard`

## üîß Environment Variables

No additional environment variables are needed for Google OAuth - Supabase handles the OAuth flow server-side.

## üéØ Features Implemented

- ‚úÖ Google Sign-In button on auth page
- ‚úÖ Google Sign-In button in auth modal
- ‚úÖ Automatic redirect after successful authentication
- ‚úÖ Integration with existing user dashboard
- ‚úÖ Proper error handling

## üö® Important Notes

1. **Domain Verification**: For production, you may need to verify your domain with Google
2. **OAuth Consent Screen**: Configure your OAuth consent screen in Google Cloud Console
3. **Scopes**: The default scopes include basic profile information (name, email, profile picture)
4. **Rate Limits**: Google has rate limits for OAuth requests

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"redirect_uri_mismatch"**: 
   - Check that your redirect URIs in Google Console match exactly
   - Include both HTTP (dev) and HTTPS (prod) versions

2. **"invalid_client"**:
   - Verify your Client ID and Client Secret are correct
   - Make sure they're copied without extra spaces

3. **"access_denied"**:
   - Check your OAuth consent screen configuration
   - Ensure the app is published or in testing mode with your email added

### Testing Checklist:

- [ ] Google OAuth credentials created

- [ ] Redirect URIs configured correctly
- [ ] OAuth consent screen configured
- [ ] Test sign-in flow works
