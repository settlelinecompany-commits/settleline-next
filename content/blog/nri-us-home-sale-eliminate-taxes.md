faq:
  - question: "Do NRIs qualify for the US primary-residence exclusion?"
    answer: "Yes. Under IRS Section 121, single filers can exclude up to $250,000 of gain and joint filers up to $500,000, provided the ownership and use tests are met."
  - question: "What if I move back to India and sell later?"
    answer: "The key tests are based on past ownership and use, not current residence. Even after returning, you may still qualify if you meet the 2-of-5 year rule."
  - question: "Can improving my US home reduce the taxable gain?"
    answer: "Yes—capital improvements and documented fees increase your adjusted basis, reducing the gain if you can substantiate them with receipts."

## Moving Back to India? Here’s How to Avoid US Taxes on Your Home Sale

For many NRIs, selling a US home before or after moving back to India is one of the biggest financial steps. The good news: US tax law provides ways to shrink or even eliminate capital gains tax—if you plan carefully.

## The IRS Exclusion Rule (Section 121)

The cornerstone is **IRS Section 121**, which allows up to **$250,000** exclusion for single filers and **$500,000** for married couples filing jointly. You qualify if:  
- You **owned and used** the home as your primary residence for **2 of the last 5 years**, and  
- You haven’t claimed the exclusion on another home within the past **2 years**.  

Even if you’ve already relocated to India, this exclusion can still apply based on your history of use and ownership.

**Key Statistics:**  
- **$34.5 trillion**: Total US household home equity in Q1 2025.  
- **34%** of sellers could exceed the $250,000 single cap.  
- **10%** of joint filers could exceed the $500,000 cap.  

> **Advisor Insight**: For NRIs returning home, the timing of your sale relative to your move can be decisive. Plan the sale window to maximize the Section 121 exclusion.

### Don’t Forget State Taxes

Federal exclusion doesn’t always end the story. **States like California and New York** tax gains at **ordinary income rates**, even when the federal exclusion applies. In contrast, **Texas or Florida** impose no state income tax.  

> **Advisor Insight**: NRIs often focus only on federal rules but forget states. A California home sale may trigger a significant state tax bill even if the IRS bill is zero.

### Step-Up in Basis at Death

If you hold on to your US home until death, your heirs get a **step-up in basis**—meaning the home’s value resets to fair market value. If they sell immediately, they may owe little or no capital gains tax.

## Practical Ways NRIs Can Reduce Taxable Gain

### 1) Maximize Your Adjusted Basis

Your **adjusted basis** = purchase price **+** documented improvements **+** closing costs. This directly reduces taxable gain.  

- **Examples**: Remodels, new roof, HVAC upgrades, title costs, permits.  
- **Action**: Collect receipts and invoices before you leave the US.  

> **Advisor Insight**: Many NRIs lose out by leaving records scattered. Even bank or credit card statements can help rebuild your basis file.

### 2) Hold for Long-Term Treatment

Selling before one year means gains are taxed at **ordinary rates**. Holding for **at least one year and one day** qualifies for long-term capital gains, which are typically lower.  

- **Tip**: Even delaying closing by a few weeks can change your rate bracket.

### 3) Consider an Installment Sale

If you don’t need all proceeds upfront, you can **finance the buyer** and receive payments over time. This spreads out the taxable gain, reducing the chance of jumping into a higher bracket in one year.  

- **Risk**: Buyer default.  
- **Fit**: Works best for NRIs who still have a US bank account and want smoother tax impact.  

### 4) Rent First, Then Use a 1031 Exchange

Converting your home into a rental can make it eligible for a **1031 exchange**, allowing you to roll gains into another investment property and defer US taxes.  

- **Warning**: This is a **deferral**, not elimination. You must follow strict IRS deadlines and rules.  

### 5) Use Portfolio Losses to Offset

If you hold US securities with losses, you can sell them in the same tax year as your home sale to **offset gains**. This reduces overall tax liability.


## Planning Timeline for NRIs

### 6–12 Months Before Sale
- Run gain projections with Section 121 in mind.  
- Begin compiling receipts for improvements.  
- Evaluate installment vs. cash sale.  
- Check state-specific rules if selling in CA, NY, etc.  

### 3–6 Months Before Sale
- Confirm whether you’ll qualify for **long-term treatment**.  
- Finalize documentation into a single “basis” file.  
- Set pricing with agent, factoring in tax thresholds.  
- Review portfolio for potential tax-loss harvesting.  

### 1–3 Months Before Closing
- Negotiate closing dates aligned with tax goals.  
- Draft installment-sale terms if using.  
- Prepare final estimates for state and federal liability.  
- Maintain a gain worksheet updated through closing.  

## Common Mistakes NRIs Should Avoid

### 1. Not Keeping Documentation
**Mistake**: Leaving the US without copies of receipts or improvement records.  
**Impact**: Higher taxable gain.  
**Solution**: Build a digital “basis file” before leaving.  

### 2. Selling Too Early
**Mistake**: Closing before one year and a day.  
**Impact**: Ordinary-rate taxation.  
**Solution**: Time your sale for long-term capital gains.  

### 3. Ignoring State Tax
**Mistake**: Assuming IRS exclusion = no tax.  
**Impact**: Surprises in high-tax states.  
**Solution**: Model state outcomes early.  

### 4. Taking All Proceeds at Once
**Mistake**: Cash sale without considering installment options.  
**Impact**: Bracket spike and higher net investment income tax.  
**Solution**: Spread gain using installment or portfolio offsets.  

### 5. Misusing the 1031 Option
**Mistake**: Rushing into rental conversion and 1031 exchange.  
**Impact**: Compliance burdens, missed deadlines.  
**Solution**: Use only if you plan to keep investing in US property.  

## Conclusion

For NRIs moving back to India, a US home sale doesn’t have to mean a massive tax bill. By using **Section 121 exclusions**, maximizing your **basis**, timing the sale smartly, and considering tools like installment sales or 1031 exchanges, you can often **eliminate or greatly reduce US taxes**.  

## Next Steps for NRIs

1. **Check Eligibility**: Confirm Section 121 ownership and use tests.  
2. **Build Your Basis File**: Collect receipts and improvement records.  
3. **Plan the Timing**: Target long-term rates and manage closing dates.  
4. **Choose a Strategy**: Cash, installment, or rental-to-1031, based on your move plans.  

With early preparation, NRIs can return to India with more savings intact—and fewer surprises from the IRS.
