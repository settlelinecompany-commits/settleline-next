# 401(k) Catch-Up Contributions Are Changing — Here’s What You Need to Know

If you’re age 50 or older and rely on **401(k) catch-up contributions** to boost your retirement savings, there’s a major change on the horizon.  

Beginning with **plan years starting after December 31, 2026** (effectively January 2027 for most), certain higher-income earners will no longer be able to make pretax catch-up contributions. Instead, those contributions must go into the **Roth side** of your retirement plan.  

And if your plan doesn’t offer Roth? You won’t be able to make catch-ups at all until it does.

## What’s actually changing?  

- Workers **age 50 or older** with **more than $145,000 in W-2 wages** from the same employer in the prior year must make **Roth (after-tax) catch-up contributions**.  
- The $145,000 threshold is **indexed annually for inflation**.  
- Applies to **401(k), 403(b), and governmental 457(b)** plans.  
- Does **not** apply to SIMPLE IRAs or non-governmental 457(b) plans.  
- **Self-employed individuals without W-2 wages** are not subject to this rule.  
- Effective for **plan years beginning after Dec 31, 2026**, following a transition relief period in 2024–25.

## Why does it matter?  

The main shift is **losing the upfront tax deduction** for high earners.  

- Example: A 60-year-old in the **35% tax bracket** could miss out on around a **$4,000 deduction** if they make the new “super catch-up” of **$11,250**.  
- Because Roth contributions are after-tax, they could **increase your adjusted gross income (AGI)**, which may reduce deductions or credits.  
- For some, this higher AGI might even **push them into a higher bracket**.

## Catch-up contribution limits (2025)  

*(Indexed annually for inflation)*  

- **Standard 401(k) contribution**: $23,500  
- **Catch-up (age 50+)**: +$7,500  
- **“Super catch-up” (ages 60–63)**: $11,250

## The Roth roadblock  

Not every employer offers a Roth 401(k), which could block some employees from making catch-up contributions at all.  

- **Fidelity**: 95% of workplace plans now offer Roth 401(k) (up from 73% a decade ago).  
- **Vanguard**: 86% of plans now offer Roth.  

That still leaves a minority of employees exposed unless their plan adds a Roth option before 2027.  

---

## Is there a silver lining?  

Yes. While losing the immediate deduction hurts, Roth contributions can provide long-term benefits:  

- **Withdrawals are tax-free** in retirement.  
- Adds **tax diversification** — balancing pretax, Roth, and taxable accounts.  
- Can reduce the impact of large **required minimum distributions (RMDs)** later in life.  

Think of it as **paying taxes today for flexibility tomorrow**.

## The takeaway  

From **2027**, if you’re a high earner over 50, your 401(k) catch-up contributions must be **Roth-only**.  

That means:  

1. No more upfront tax deduction.  
2. Possibly higher AGI in working years.  
3. Tax-free withdrawals in retirement.  

**What to do now:**  

- Confirm if your employer’s plan already offers a **Roth 401(k)**.  
- If not, ask HR or your plan provider.  
- Revisit your retirement strategy with an advisor to balance pretax and Roth buckets.  

The rules are changing — but with smart planning, you can still make catch-up contributions work for you.

## FAQ  

**Q. Does this apply to everyone over 50?**  
No. Only those earning **over $145,000 in W-2 wages** with the same employer in the prior year must use Roth.  

**Q. What if my employer doesn’t offer Roth 401(k)?**  
Then, starting 2027, you cannot make catch-up contributions at all until your plan adds Roth.  

**Q. Is Roth always worse?**  
Not necessarily — Roth withdrawals are **completely tax-free** in retirement, which can help reduce your future tax burden.
