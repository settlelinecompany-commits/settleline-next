faq:
  - question: "What happens if I get laid off while on H-1B?"
    answer: "You generally have up to 60 days or until I-94 expiry—whichever is earlier—to transfer your H-1B, file a change of status, or depart. Timely filings can place you in a period of authorized stay while USCIS adjudicates."
  - question: "Do I still need to file U.S. taxes after an H-1B layoff?"
    answer: "Yes. For the year you worked, you must file a U.S. return (Form 1040 if you meet the Substantial Presence Test, otherwise 1040NR). State rules may also apply."
  - question: "How can RNOR status help after a U.S. layoff?"
    answer: "During RNOR (typically 2–3 years), foreign-sourced income accruing and received outside India is generally not taxable in India, except income from a business controlled in or a profession set up in India."

# Laid Off on H-1B Visa: What Global Professionals Must Know

With U.S. tech layoffs, many H-1B professionals face sudden disruption. Beyond the emotional stress, you need to manage **immigration deadlines**, **U.S. tax filings**, and **India tax residency planning**. Here’s how to navigate this cross-border challenge.

---

## 1) Immigration first: your 60-day window

- After H-1B termination, you generally have **up to 60 days** or **until your I-94 expires** (whichever is earlier) to:  
  **(a)** transfer H-1B to a new employer, **(b)** file a **change of status** (e.g., H-4/F-1/O-1), or **(c)** **depart** the U.S.  
- Filing a **timely, non-frivolous** change-of-status or extension within this period keeps you in a **period of authorized stay** while USCIS processes your case.  
- Inaction can result in **unlawful presence** and future re-entry bans.

---

## 2) U.S. tax after layoff

- For the year you worked, you must file a **U.S. federal tax return**: **Form 1040** if you meet the **Substantial Presence Test (SPT)**, or **Form 1040NR** otherwise.  
- **RSUs**: Taxed as **ordinary wage income at vest/delivery**, usually reported on **Form W-2**. Unvested RSUs typically forfeit on termination unless your plan accelerates vesting.  
- **States** like California or New York may tax part-year residents and income sourced in-state even after departure.

---

## 3) Return-to-India & the RNOR advantage

If you qualify as **RNOR (Resident but Not Ordinarily Resident)** for 2–3 years:  

- **Foreign-sourced income** accruing and received outside India is **not taxable**.  
- Exceptions: income from a **business controlled in India** or a **profession set up in India**.  
- Once you transition to **ROR (Resident and Ordinarily Resident)**, global income is taxable.  

> **Strategy:** Time foreign asset liquidations (brokerage, RSUs, 401(k)) during RNOR years, and avoid remitting proceeds to India immediately to preserve RNOR benefits.

---

## 4) Double taxation risks & relief

- Severance, RSUs, or 401(k) withdrawals may be taxed first in the **U.S.**, and later again in India once you are **ROR**.  
- To prevent double taxation:  
  - Apply **India–U.S. DTAA** articles for salary, capital gains, or pensions.  
  - File **Form 67** in India to claim **Foreign Tax Credit (FTC)**.  
- **Form 67 timing**: Can be filed **up to the end of the relevant assessment year** (and also with updated returns under section 139(8A)).

## 5) Compliance checklist after H-1B layoff

- **Banking**: Keep a U.S. account open for refunds/final payroll.  
- **Retirement**: Assess **401(k) rollover**, IRA, or Roth conversion options; weigh penalties if withdrawing.  
- **Brokerage**: Track U.S. capital gains; align disposals with RNOR years.  
- **Property**: U.S. rental income is taxable in India when ROR; claim **FTC via Form 67**.  
- **Foreign assets (Schedule FA & BMA)**:  
  - Historically, non-disclosure invited a **₹10 lakh/year penalty** under the **Black Money Act, 2015**.  
  - **From Oct 1, 2024**, relief applies: no penalty/prosecution if **foreign movable assets ≤ ₹20 lakh aggregate** (immovable property excluded).  
  - Important: This is **penalty relief only**; Schedule FA disclosure in the ITR remains mandatory when you are ROR.

## 6) New slab rates (Budget 2025)

From **FY 2025-26 (AY 2026-27)**:  

- **Nil tax up to ₹12 lakh**.  
- For salaried, the **₹75,000 standard deduction** raises this to **~₹12.75 lakh**.  
- Special-rate incomes (like certain capital gains) remain outside this nil-tax benefit.  

---

## Conclusion

An H-1B layoff is more than an immigration issue—it’s a **cross-border compliance challenge**. You must manage:  

- **Immigration deadlines** (60-day grace).  
- **U.S. exit and tax filings**.  
- **RNOR years** to shield foreign income.  
- **DTAA + Form 67** for tax credits.  
- **Schedule FA** disclosures to avoid penalties.

## Next steps

- Verify your **grace-period expiry** and immigration options.  
- Prepare your **U.S. final returns** (federal + state).  
- Plan **RNOR/DTAA timing** before moving assets.  
- Get a **cross-border review** of RSUs, severance, 401(k), and property with Settleline’s CA/CPA team.
