faq:
  - question: "Is there personal income tax in the UAE?"
    answer: "No, the UAE does not levy personal income tax on salaries. However, since June 2023, a federal corporate tax applies on business profits above the threshold."
  - question: "Is UAE income taxable in India?"
    answer: "If you are an NRI or RNOR, UAE income is not taxable in India unless received here. As an ROR, your global income, including UAE salary or business profits, becomes taxable in India."
  - question: "How does the UAE–India DTAA help?"
    answer: "The treaty prevents double taxation. If taxes are paid in the UAE (e.g., corporate tax), you can claim Foreign Tax Credit in India by filing Form 67."

# UAE and India Tax Rules for NRIs: What You Need to Know

The UAE remains one of the most popular destinations for Indian professionals. While the Emirates provide a tax-free salary environment, returning to India or becoming tax resident here changes how your UAE income is treated. Here’s a complete guide for NRIs.

---

## 1. Taxation in the UAE

- **No personal income tax:** The UAE does not tax salaries.  
- **Corporate tax (from 1 June 2023):** A federal **9% tax** applies on business profits exceeding AED 375,000.  
- **VAT:** A **5% Value Added Tax** applies to goods and services, but it does not affect individual salary income.

---

## 2. Taxation in India

Your **Indian tax residency** determines how UAE income is taxed:

- **NRI:** Only India-sourced income is taxed. UAE salary or business profits retained abroad are outside India’s scope.  
- **RNOR:** Foreign income is taxed in India only if **received in India** or if it arises from a **business/profession controlled from India**.  
- **ROR:** **Worldwide income** becomes taxable, including UAE salary, corporate profits, and overseas investments—even if retained abroad.

---

## 3. UAE–India Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA)

The India–UAE DTAA prevents double taxation:

- **Corporate tax:** If you pay UAE corporate tax, you may claim **Foreign Tax Credit (FTC)** in India. To do so, file **Form 67** before your ITR (or at least by the end of the assessment year).  
- **Salary income:** Because UAE does not levy personal income tax, there is **no FTC available**. Once you become ROR, India will tax your UAE salary in full.  
- **RNOR benefit:** Strategic RNOR planning provides a temporary 2–3 year shield from India tax on UAE earnings.

---

## 4. Indian compliance requirements

- **Form 67:** Mandatory for claiming FTC against UAE corporate tax.  
- **Schedule FA:** ROR taxpayers must disclose UAE bank accounts, companies, and investments.  
- **Penalties:** Non-disclosure attracts a **₹10 lakh per year penalty** under the Black Money Act. From **1 Oct 2024**, relief applies for *movable* assets up to **₹20 lakh**, but **immovable property must always be disclosed**.  
- **Advance Tax:** If your India tax liability exceeds ₹10,000, pay advance tax quarterly to avoid interest under **Sections 234B/234C**.

## 5. UAE residency vs. tax residency

Holding a **UAE residence visa** is not the same as being a **UAE tax resident**. The rules are defined by Cabinet Decision No. 85 of 2022:

- **183-day test:** Stay at least 183 days in the UAE during the year.  
- **90-day test:** Possible if you spend 90+ days in the UAE and have strong ties (home, family, or business).  
- **Evidence required:** Flight tickets, lease agreements, utilities, and bank records must substantiate your claim.

---

### Why it matters

- **Canada:** Maintains tax residence if you keep ties like family or property.  
- **Norway:** Taxes former residents for up to 3 years unless new residency is proven.  
- **US:** Citizens are taxed on **worldwide income** regardless of residence (only renunciation or Puerto Rico exception changes this).

---

### The “Nomad + Dubai Visa” myth

Some claim: *“Set up a freezone company, get a UAE visa, travel worldwide, and pay zero tax.”*  
Reality:  
- Without 183+ days in the UAE, you are **not a UAE tax resident**.  
- Stateless individuals often remain taxable in their home country.  
- High-tax jurisdictions aggressively pursue those without clear residency.

---

### What you should do

- **Commit to UAE:** Spend 183+ days, secure housing, open bank accounts, and build ties.  
- **Explore alternatives:** If not feasible, consider structured low-tax residencies in other jurisdictions.  
- **Keep documentation:** Preserve travel and residency evidence.

---

## Conclusion

While UAE offers a tax-free salary, India’s **global taxation rules** make planning essential when your residency changes. **RNOR timing, DTAA, Form 67, and Schedule FA** are the key tools to manage risk and avoid penalties.

Settleline can help you design a **tax roadmap** for returning from the UAE to India with clarity and compliance.
