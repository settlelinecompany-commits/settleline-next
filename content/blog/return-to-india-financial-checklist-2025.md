faq:
  - question: "What is the RNOR golden window and why does it matter?"
    answer: "RNOR (Resident but Not Ordinarily Resident) status allows returning NRIs to keep foreign income tax-free in India for 2–3 years. This is a crucial window for restructuring assets."
  - question: "Do NRIs need to close their US retirement accounts before returning?"
    answer: "No. Withdrawing everything may trigger penalties and double taxation. It’s often better to keep accounts invested strategically with proper reporting."
  - question: "Can NRIs still receive US Social Security after moving back to India?"
    answer: "Yes. Benefits continue as long as eligibility rules are met. The myth that you lose Social Security by relocating is false."

## Why a Return-to-India Checklist Matters

For NRIs, moving back to India is more than a change of address — it’s a financial, emotional, and compliance marathon. From managing overseas assets to converting bank accounts, every step requires foresight.  

This **Return to India Financial Checklist 2025** brings together what you need to prepare — from six months before your move to six months after.

---

## 6 Months Before the Move

- **Evaluate and consult** a cross-border knowledge partner.  
- **Decide on big assets**: Will you sell or keep your US home?  
- **Run your numbers**: Factor in healthcare without employer coverage, kids’ education, housing, a 12+ month emergency fund, and investment capital.  

---

## 3 Months Before the Move

- **If selling property**: Begin preparations with brokers, listings, and legal work.  
- **If renting**: Evaluate property management companies.  
- **If on rent**: Give notice to your landlord.  
- **Retirement accounts**: Discuss rollover options; plan an exit strategy without triggering penalties.  
- **Overseas investments**: Decide whether to liquidate, repatriate, or restructure.  
- **RNOR planning**: Consider returning after February 1 to extend your NRI status for that financial year.  

---

## 1 Month Before the Move

- **Sell your car** and simplify assets.  
- **Close accounts you won’t keep**: bank accounts, trading accounts, credit cards.  
- **Transfer equity** if you’re keeping US investments — explore platforms that support residents in India.  
- **Digitize documents**:  
  - KYC & visa documents, OCI cards  
  - Bank & investment statements  
  - Tax returns  
  - Insurance policies, medical records

- **Update contact details** with overseas banks and insurers.  
- **Transfer INR funds**: Ensure 2–3 months’ expenses in an Indian bank account.  

---

## 1 Week Before the Move

- **Prepare your take-off docket**: passport, visa documents, cash (INR + USD), logistics bookings, international roaming.  
- **Relax**: Give yourself breathing space before the transition.  

---

## 1 Week After the Move

- **Adjust emotionally**: Reverse culture shock is real — smells, sounds, food, and traffic can overwhelm.  
- **Family first**: Spend time with parents, relatives, and set up caregiving systems if needed.  
- **Local recce**: SIM card, UPI setup, neighbors, grocery stores, and healthcare contacts.  

---

## 2 Weeks After the Move

- **Update KYC in India**: Aadhaar, PAN, bank accounts, insurance, MF folios.  
- **Update overseas accounts**: Provide new address and KYC details.  

---

## 1 Month After the Move

- **Banking transitions**: Convert NRE/NRO to resident accounts; update demat status.  
- **Remittances**: Choose efficient channels and currency-holding mechanisms.  
- **Credit history**: Start building Indian credit with local cards.  
- **Insurance review**: Activate/update health and term life coverage.  

---

## 3 Months After the Move

- **DTAA strategy**: Understand treaty benefits between India and your overseas country.  
- **Foreign asset declaration**: Prepare for Schedule FA compliance.  
- **Investment restructuring**: Adjust global portfolios for your new residency.  

---

## 6 Months After the Move

- **Estate planning**:  
  - **Overseas assets**: Secure and minimize estate taxes.  
  - **Indian assets**: Draft or update your will, consider setting up a trust.  

---

## Other Critical Checklist Items

### The Indian Banking Transition
- Convert **NRE accounts** to resident or RFC accounts.  
- Hold **FCNR deposits** until maturity, then convert.  
- Notify all banks, brokers, and financial institutions — it’s mandatory.  

### The Retirement Account Strategy
- Avoid panic withdrawals (often a 10% penalty + double taxation).  
- Keep 401(k), IRA, and brokerage accounts invested strategically.  
- **HSA tip**: Eligible for use in India with proper documentation.  

### The Social Security Myth
- Myth: You lose US Social Security if you move.  
- Reality: Benefits continue with conditions — don’t leave money on the table.  

### The Property Decision
- **Sell**: Clean exit, but watch US/India capital gains tax.  
- **Rent**: Income stream, but adds compliance.  
- **Hold**: Potential growth, but higher costs.  
- Pro tip: Plan 3–5 years ahead, not in the moment.  

### The Forms That Matter
- **Form W-8BEN**: A single mistake can trigger excess US tax withholding.  
- Don’t DIY — correcting mistakes is costlier than doing it right the first time.  

### Cutting Through the Noise
- Everyone will give advice — friends, family, WhatsApp groups.  
- But your **401(k) ≠ their stocks**.  
- Your **timeline ≠ their plan**.  
- Personalize your strategy.
