faq:
  - question: "What is Form 67 used for?"
    answer: "Form 67 is used to claim Foreign Tax Credit in India so that income already taxed overseas is not taxed again when reported in India."
  - question: "Who needs to file Form 67?"
    answer: "ROR taxpayers must file Form 67 whenever claiming FTC. RNORs may also need it if foreign income is taxable in India (e.g., received in India or from a business/profession controlled from India)."
  - question: "When should Form 67 be filed?"
    answer: "Best practice is to file it before filing your ITR. Legally, CBDT permits filing up to the end of the relevant assessment year for original/belated returns, and before furnishing an updated return under section 139(8A)."

# Form 67: A Complete Guide for Global NRIs Returning to India

For NRIs returning from the **US, UK, Canada, Australia, Singapore, the Middle East, or anywhere else**, one of the most common tax challenges is **double taxation**—paying tax on the same income abroad and again in India.

The compliance tool that prevents this is **Form 67**. Whether you are in your **RNOR (Resident but Not Ordinarily Resident)** period or have moved into **ROR (Resident and Ordinarily Resident)** status, Form 67 helps you protect eligible foreign-taxed income from being taxed twice in India.

## What is Form 67?

**Form 67** (filed online on the Income-tax e-Filing portal) enables a resident taxpayer to claim **Foreign Tax Credit (FTC)** for taxes paid in a foreign country under **Rule 128** read with **Sections 90/90A/91** of the Income-tax Act. It is the procedural backbone for applying **DTAA** relief or unilateral relief in India.

Without filing Form 67 within the permitted timeline, FTC may be **denied** during processing—even if a DTAA applies.

---

## When does Form 67 apply?

- **NRI (Non-Resident):** Only Indian-sourced income is taxable → Form 67 **not required** for foreign income.  
- **RNOR:** Foreign income is taxable in India **only if** it is **received in India** or arises from a **business controlled in India / profession set up in India**. If such foreign income is taxable in India and tax was paid abroad, file **Form 67** to claim FTC.  
- **ROR (Resident & Ordinarily Resident):** **Global income is taxable in India**. Form 67 is **mandatory whenever you claim FTC** for foreign-taxed income.

> **Settleline Tip:** Form 67 is optional for NRIs, **situational** for RNORs (based on taxability in India), and **mandatory** for RORs where FTC is claimed.

---

## Why NRIs must pay attention in RNOR and ROR

- In the **RNOR window (typically 2–3 years)**: most foreign income that **accrues/arises and is received outside India** is not taxable in India. But if you **remit** overseas income into India, or if it is from a **business/profession controlled from India**, it can become taxable—then **Form 67** is needed to claim FTC (where foreign tax exists).  
- As a **ROR**, your **worldwide income**—RSUs in the US, pensions in the UK, dividends in Singapore, rental income in other jurisdictions—becomes taxable in India. **Form 67** is essential to claim FTC and avoid double taxation.

---

## Global use-cases for Form 67

- **Equity compensation (RSUs/stock options):** Taxed abroad (e.g., US/UK/Canada/Australia). If taxable in India (ROR; or RNOR with Indian receipt/control), file **Form 67** to claim FTC.  
- **Rental property abroad:** If the rental income is **taxed in the source country** (e.g., UK) and is **taxable in India**, file **Form 67**. (Note: some countries may not tax individual rental income—FTC depends on actual foreign tax paid.)  
- **Retirement income:** Pensions/withdrawals (e.g., US 401(k), UK pension, Australian superannuation) often face foreign tax—file **Form 67** when taxable in India.  
- **Global investments:** Dividends, interest, capital gains from foreign brokerage accounts—if taxed abroad and taxable in India, **Form 67** secures FTC.

## How to file Form 67

### Filing timeline (practical workflow)

**6–12 months before ITR filing**  
- Gather foreign returns and tax certificates (e.g., IRS transcripts/1099s, HMRC SA302, CRA T5, ATO assessments).  
- Track remittances to India and India-linkages (control of business/profession).  
- Map applicable **DTAA** article(s) with your CA.

**3–6 months before ITR filing**  
- Log in to the IT portal → **e-File → Income Tax Forms → File Income Tax Forms**.  
- Select **Form 67**, report foreign income/foreign tax, attach proofs, quote relevant treaty article(s).  

**1–3 months before ITR filing**  
- **File Form 67 before filing the ITR** (best practice).  
- Law allows filing **up to the end of the Assessment Year** for original/belated returns, and **before** furnishing an updated return under **139(8A)**.  
- Ensure alignment with **Schedule FA**, **Schedule FSI**, and **Schedule TR**; e-verify submissions.

### Supporting documents (illustrative)

- Foreign tax returns and assessments (IRS/HMRC/CRA/ATO/IRAS etc.).  
- Withholding certificates (e.g., Forms W-2/1099/Year-end payslips, RSU statements).  
- Brokerage tax statements and gain/loss reports.  
- Bank evidence for India remittances (if any).  
- Interpreted **DTAA** provisions (article number, method of relief).

## Common mistakes to avoid

**1) Filing Form 67 after ITR**  
- **Impact:** FTC commonly **denied** at processing.  
- **Fix:** File Form 67 **before** ITR as a best-practice, even though Rule 128 permits end-of-AY filing for original/belated returns.

**2) Assuming RNOR = no compliance**  
- **Impact:** FTC missed where RNOR income becomes taxable (receipt in India; India-controlled business/profession).  
- **Fix:** Evaluate taxability first; if taxable in India and taxed abroad, **file Form 67**.

**3) Incorrect treaty articles**  
- **Impact:** FTC disallowance.  
- **Fix:** Cross-check DTAA mapping (salary vs dividends vs capital gains vs pensions) with a cross-border CA.

**4) Ignoring Schedule FA / BMA**  
- **Impact:** **Black Money Act** consequences; historically penalties up to **₹10 lakh per year** for non-disclosure.  
- **Update:** **From 1 Oct 2024**, Finance (No. 2) Act, 2024 introduced **relief**—no BMA penalty if the **aggregate value of foreign **movable** assets** does **not exceed ₹20 lakh** in the year (**immovable property excluded**). CBDT (Aug 2025) also aligned **prosecution relief** with this threshold.  
- **Fix:** This is **penalty/prosecution relief**, **not** an exemption from **Schedule FA** reporting. When in doubt, **disclose**.

## Conclusion

**Form 67** is the gateway to **Foreign Tax Credit**.  
- As **RNOR**, it applies only when foreign income is **taxable in India**.  
- As **ROR**, it is **mandatory whenever you claim FTC**.  

Skipping it can cost you FTC denials and penalties—often running into lakhs.

## Next steps

1. Check your **residency each year** (NRI → RNOR → ROR).  
2. Identify **which foreign incomes are taxable in India** (receipt and control tests).  
3. Collect **foreign tax documents** early.  
4. **File Form 67 before ITR** (best practice) to avoid processing mismatches.  
5. When unsure, work with a **cross-border CA** to map DTAA relief accurately.
