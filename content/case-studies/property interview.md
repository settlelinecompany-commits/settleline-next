faq:
  - question: "Can NRIs claim Section 54 exemption on sale of foreign property?"
    answer: "Yes, if the capital gains are taxable in India and the reinvestment is made into an eligible residential property located in India within the specified timelines."
  - question: "Are mutual fund SIPs a good option for returning NRIs?"
    answer: "Yes, SIPs in Indian equity and debt funds help diversify. Tax rules differ from the U.S., so RNOR planning and capital gains treatment should be considered."

## Customer Story: Buying Property & Investing in India

**Client:** Arjun, returning NRI (ex-US)  
**Objective:** Reinvest U.S. property sale proceeds into an Indian home and diversify wealth into Indian equity markets.

After working in the U.S. for 12 years, Arjun moved back to Bangalore with his family. His two big financial goals were (1) purchasing a permanent home and (2) starting systematic investments for long-term growth. The hurdles were **capital gains taxation**, **FEMA restrictions**, and ensuring he didn’t lose the benefit of his **RNOR window**.

---

### The Challenges
- **Capital Gains Exposure:** Arjun sold his U.S. property before returning. Without planning, the capital gains would have been taxable in India.  
- **Property Funding Rules:** Needed clarity on using NRE/NRO balances, inward remittances, and FEMA restrictions on property classes.  
- **Investment Strategy:** Wanted to diversify into Indian SIPs but was unsure of taxation differences vs U.S. markets.  
- **Compliance Load:** Had to disclose foreign assets under **Schedule FA** and stay compliant during RNOR → ROR transition.

---

### Settleline’s Approach
- **Section 54 Roadmap:** Structured a reinvestment into a Bangalore residential property, ensuring compliance with Section 54 timelines to fully shelter long-term capital gains.  
- **FEMA Execution:** Guided on the correct funding mix (NRO + inward remittance via AD Bank), completed FEMA documentation, and clarified that **Form 15CA/CB applies only to outbound remittances**, not inward funding.  
- **RNOR Optimization:** Scheduled foreign stock disposals during RNOR years, so gains remained non-taxable in India.  
- **SIP Setup:** Helped select equity mutual funds and explained Indian capital gains rules vs U.S. taxation, ensuring no double taxation under DTAA with proper Form 67 filings.

### Outcomes
- **Complete exemption** of U.S. property capital gains via Section 54 reinvestment in India.  
- **Bangalore house purchased in ~90 days**, with FEMA and AD bank approvals in place.  
- **SIP portfolio launched** with a clear tax roadmap for equity/debt treatment in India.  
- **Zero compliance penalties**, with Schedule FA and ITR filings handled seamlessly.

## Key Takeaways for NRIs
- **Use Section 54 smartly:** Gains from foreign property are eligible if they are taxable in India and reinvested into a house in India.  
- **Plan RNOR years:** Foreign income is generally not taxable in India if it accrues and is received outside India during RNOR.  
- **Diversify early:** SIPs in India offer growth, but taxation differs from the U.S. — get advice before committing.  
- **Stay compliant:** FEMA restrictions, outbound remittance (15CA/CB), and Schedule FA aren’t optional; non-disclosure penalties are severe.
