faq:
  - question: "Can an NRI use a foreign holding company to set up an Indian subsidiary?"
    answer: "Yes. FEMA/NDI rules permit foreign investment into Indian companies (subject to sectoral conditions). Post-issue reporting like FC-GPR via RBI’s FIRMS portal is mandatory within 30 days of allotment."
  - question: "Which filings are typical for foreign investment into an Indian company?"
    answer: "A typical sequence is: receive funds (AD bank FIRC), issue shares within 60 days of receipt, file FC-GPR within 30 days of allotment on FIRMS, and file the Annual FLA return by July 15 if applicable. For related-party pricing, maintain Rule 10D TP documentation and file Form 3CEB."

## Customer Story: Business Setup in India with Offshore Compliance

**Client:** Rohan, NRI entrepreneur (based in Singapore)  
**Objective:** Establish an Indian **Private Limited** company while maintaining a **Singapore holding** for global operations.

Rohan wanted to start billing Indian clients locally while retaining the brand credibility and operational advantages of his Singapore HQ. The key risks were **FEMA/RBI compliance** on inbound capital, **foreign-asset disclosure** obligations in India, and preventing **double taxation** on cross-border flows.

### The Challenges
- **Right Structure:** Decide between a direct India Pvt Ltd vs an Indian subsidiary under the Singapore parent.  
- **Capital Inflows:** Ensure compliant **FEMA** processes, **RBI** filings, and **Authorized Dealer (AD) Bank** coordination for foreign investment.  
- **Cross-Border Tax & Disclosure:** Align **DTAA** treatment, **withholding/repatriation** flows; manage **Schedule FA** and **transfer pricing** to avoid penalties.

### Settleline’s Approach
- **Entity Structuring:** Recommended an **Indian subsidiary** under the Singapore holding to combine global credibility with domestic compliance.
- **FEMA & RBI Execution:**  
  - Coordinated **AD bank** onboarding and captured **FIRC** as proof of remittance.  
  - Ensured **share allotment within 60 days of receipt** and filed **Form FC-GPR within 30 days of allotment** through the **RBI FIRMS/SMF** portal (with AD bank verification).  
- **DTAA-Consistent Tax Plan:** Implemented a **withholding & repatriation** model aligned to the India–Singapore treaty, with **TRC + Form 10F** and **no-PE** checks to make treaty relief defensible.  
- **Year-Round Compliance:** Took over **Schedule FA** (foreign asset disclosure), **transfer pricing** (Rule 10D file + **Form 3CEB**), and **ITR** support to keep the structure audit-ready.
- **Regulatory Calendar:** Set up reminders for the **Annual FLA return** (July 15) for foreign liabilities/assets reporting, where applicable.

### Outcomes
- **Incorporation in ~6 weeks**, with all initial FEMA/RBI steps completed (timelines vary by RoC and bank KYC).  
- **Local invoicing** enabled for India clients; **global clients** continued under the Singapore parent.  
- **~30% compliance cost savings in this engagement** versus a fragmented multi-advisor setup.  
- A **robust, compliant cross-border framework** with clear pathways for future scale and repatriation.

## Key Takeaways for NRIs Considering India Expansion
- **Decide structure upfront:** Parent–subsidiary choices are easier (and cheaper) to set at the start than to fix later.  
- **Lock FEMA/RBI hygiene:** **FIRC → allot within 60 days → FC-GPR within 30 days → FLA by July 15** (if applicable).  
- **Model cross-border flows:** Use **DTAA-aligned** pricing/withholding; **relief requires TRC + Form 10F** and meeting treaty conditions (e.g., no PE/service PE).  
- **Stay disclosure-clean:** **Schedule FA** and **transfer pricing** aren’t optional; **nondisclosure risks penalties under the Black Money Act**.
