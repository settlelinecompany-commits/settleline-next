# Meta Engineer Success Story: Seamless US-India Transition with Full Compliance

Our Meta engineer client achieved a smooth return to India while maintaining full compliance with complex FBAR and FATCA requirements, optimizing their tax position across both countries.

## The Challenge

The client, a Software Engineer at Meta, had accumulated significant assets and investments over 5 years in the US, including multiple bank accounts, investment accounts, and retirement savings. Their planned return to India required careful compliance management.

**Key Challenges:**
- Multiple US bank accounts and investment accounts requiring FBAR reporting
- Complex FATCA compliance requirements for foreign assets
- Need to maintain compliance during transition period
- Optimizing tax position across both jurisdictions
- Managing ongoing reporting obligations

**Client Background:**
- **Company**: Meta Platforms
- **Role**: Software Engineer with 5 years of experience
- **Situation**: Multiple US accounts and assets requiring compliance management
- **Timeline**: 4 months to plan before return, 12 months execution

> **Settleline Expert Insight**: "This case required meticulous attention to compliance details, particularly around FBAR and FATCA requirements, while ensuring the client could maintain their RNOR status benefits." — Priya Sharma, Senior Tax Advisor, 12 years experience

## Our Approach

We developed a comprehensive compliance and tax optimization strategy that ensured seamless transition while maintaining full compliance with all reporting requirements.

### Phase 1: Compliance Assessment & Planning

We conducted a thorough analysis of all the client's US accounts and assets to identify compliance requirements.

**Key Activities:**
- Analyzed 8 different US bank and investment accounts
- Reviewed all assets for FBAR and FATCA reporting requirements
- Assessed current compliance status and gaps
- Developed comprehensive compliance framework

**Critical Findings:**
- $1.5M in total US assets across multiple accounts
- 6 accounts requiring FBAR reporting (over $10K threshold)
- 4 investment accounts requiring FATCA compliance
- Current compliance gaps that needed immediate attention

### Phase 2: Compliance Framework Development

Based on our analysis, we developed a comprehensive compliance framework that addressed all reporting requirements.

**Strategic Elements:**
- **FBAR Compliance System**: Automated reporting for all foreign accounts
- **FATCA Management**: Proper reporting of foreign assets and income
- **Tax Optimization**: Strategic planning to maximize RNOR benefits
- **Ongoing Monitoring**: Systems for continuous compliance management

> **Settleline Expert Tip**: "The key was establishing systems that would work seamlessly during the transition period and continue to provide compliance protection long-term." — Rajesh Kumar, Senior CA

### Phase 3: Implementation & Execution

We implemented the compliance framework and tax optimization strategy over a 12-month period.

**Implementation Timeline:**
- **Month 1-2**: Established compliance systems and filed initial reports
- **Month 3-4**: Optimized tax position and coordinated with transition
- **Month 5-8**: Monitored compliance and adjusted strategy as needed
- **Month 9-12**: Fine-tuned systems and ensured ongoing compliance

## The Results
