# How Rajesh Saved Lakhs During His Return to India

Moving back to India isn't as simple as closing U.S. accounts and buying a home. Once new tax slabs, RNOR rules, and foreign asset disclosures kick in, NRIs often risk double taxation and penalties.  

Here's how Rajesh Mehta (name anonymized), a senior product manager at Microsoft, avoided lakhs in extra tax with Settleline's roadmap.

## Rajesh's Case at a Glance

Rajesh returned to Bangalore after 9 years in the U.S.

**Key Statistics:**
- ₹10L Schedule FA penalty risk avoided
- ₹7.5L saved in RSU tax credits via Form 67
- 2 years of RNOR planning created ₹12L+ optimization opportunity

### Challenge 1: RSU Vesting in a Split Year

His stock compensation was tied to both U.S. and India workdays. If not allocated correctly, it would have been taxed twice.

- **Key Point 1**: **Risk**: RSU income tied to both U.S. and India workdays could face **double taxation**

> **Settleline Expert Tip**: RSUs are not simple salary. Without workday allocation, you pay tax twice. Always match vest dates with residency. — Shalu Tyagi, CA, Cross-Border Advisor

### RNOR Misunderstood

Rajesh assumed RNOR status meant his foreign income wouldn't be taxed.

**Important Data Point**: Average client saves **₹3.2L annually** by timing remittances during RNOR instead of after.

> **Settleline Expert Tip**: Use RNOR to liquidate foreign assets strategically. After RNOR, the same income may be taxed at 30%. — Rajesh Kumar, CPA

### Schedule FA Risks

US brokerage + retirement accounts triggered **Schedule FA disclosure**. Missing this would have cost Rajesh **₹10L penalty per year**.

**Key Statistics:**
- 89% of NRIs miss at least one FA reporting rule.
- Penalty often exceeds the actual tax owed.

> **Settleline Expert Tip**: Schedule FA is a compliance trap. Even dormant accounts must be disclosed. — Priya Sharma, Senior Tax Advisor

## The Roadmap We Built

## Pre-Return Checklist

**6-12 Months Before:** 
- Reviewed foreign assets + RSU vesting calendar
- Planned RNOR strategy for 2 years
- Evaluated property purchase timing

**3-6 Months Before:**
- Prepared Form 67 draft for DTAA credit
- Planned asset sales for Section 54F eligibility
- Opened Indian NRO/NRE accounts

**1-3 Months Before:**
- Executed asset transfers abroad
- Documented all brokerage and 401k holdings
- Finalized compliance tracker for Schedule FA

### During RNOR Window

**Residency & Income Planning**  
- Monitored physical presence day count
- Timed remittances to avoid taxation
- Aligned RSU vesting with U.S. filing deadlines

**Compliance Setup**  
- Filed advance tax estimates quarterly
- Built FA disclosure templates for filing season

### Post-RNOR Transition

**6 Months Before RNOR Ends:**
- Completed major foreign asset sales
- Locked in property purchase exemptions
- Prepared transition to ROR taxation

**3 Months Before RNOR Ends:**
- Adjusted portfolio to Indian tax regime
- Set up long-term compliance calendar
- Finalized wealth management strategy


## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Ignoring RSU Allocation

**Mistake**: Treating RSUs as normal salary.  
**Impact**: Taxed twice in U.S. and India.  
**Solution**: Allocate vesting based on workdays + file Form 67

**Real Example**: A client's RSUs vested after his return, triggering full tax in India despite U.S. withholdings. With Form 67 and DTAA relief, we reduced his tax burden by 40%.

> **Settleline Expert Tip**: Prevention is key. Always document workday allocation and file Form 67 to claim DTAA credits. — Shalu Tyagi, CA, Cross-Border Advisor

### 2. Misusing RNOR

**Mistake**: Assuming RNOR = zero tax.  
**Impact**: Foreign remittances taxed unexpectedly.  
**Solution**: Keep foreign income abroad until RNOR ends

### 3. Missing Schedule FA

**Mistake**: Not disclosing foreign bank/brokerage accounts.  
**Impact**: ₹10L penalty per year.  
**Solution**: Track and disclose all accounts annually.

### 4. Poor Timing of Asset Transfers

**Mistake**: Selling foreign assets after RNOR ends.  
**Impact**: 20–30% capital gains tax in India.  
**Solution**: Sell strategically during RNOR.

### 5. No Advance Tax Planning

**Mistake**: Paying all taxes at year-end.  
**Impact**: 234B/234C penalties.  
**Solution**: File advance tax quarterly. 

## Conclusion

Rajesh's case shows why **planning, not assumptions**, determines whether NRIs save or overpay lakhs. With RNOR timing, DTAA credits, Schedule FA compliance, and property structuring, he avoided double tax and penalties.

## Next Steps

If you're returning to India:

1. **Check RNOR eligibility** – know your 2–3 year window.
2. **Align RSU vesting & income timing** – avoid double tax.
3. **Prepare Schedule FA early** – penalties are steep.
4. **Use DTAA + Form 67** – don't miss foreign tax credits

Every return case is unique. Working with cross-border experts ensures your wealth is protected while staying compliant.
